        <!--
          My name is Conal Thomas-McGinnis and I graduated from The University of Iowa
          in December of 2022 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, and a Bachelor's in
          Philosophy. I have had a passion for all things digital since I was given a Dell
          laptop in 2012 for use in debate, an extracurricular I participated in from the 5th
          grade all throughout highschool. While I was supposed to use the computer for solely
          research and case composition, I spent plenty of time playing games, and tinkering
          with code. This interest was cemented when I took part in a GameMaker Summer Camp
          and started making my own games. Then, in my Sophomore year of high school, I
          lept onto the opportunity to take the first available computer science course I could,
          and took every subsequent course until AP Computer Science A and AP Computer Science
          Principles in my junior and senior years. Then, I dedicated my college experience
          to computer science at every opportunity, while also applying my debate skills to
          a philosophy major. 

          After graduating in 2022, I began to supplement my college education by teaching myself
          specific languages, libraries, and APIs to advance towards my goal of cementing myself
          in a career in the computer sciences. My experience at the University of Iowa was fantastic,
          and I gained the skills and wherewithal to quickly pick up and adapt to different
          programming environments and frameworks. However, most potential employers I've come
          across have wants for specific areas of experience, largely including ones that I
          was never exposed to at the University. After struggling to secure a job in the field
          with only my college experience representing me, I've set to the task of fleshing out
          a stronger personal portfolio to demonstrate that, in spite of my lack in active job
          experience in the field, I am an intelligent and capable programmer. One aspect of this
          task that you're interfacing with right now is my portfolio website, made from scratch
          to put my works on display!

          This page is hosted through GithubPages and uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          As such, I have not implemented any server scripting with PHP or otherwise. I have also opted to
          construct the site largely from scratch, as opposed to using libraries like React.js. This is
          because this site is only intended to be a static gallery, whose purpose is to show
          off my portfolio and my resume.

          Throughout the process of learning how to utilize HTML and CSS alongside my understanding of Java
          and JavaScript, I have done lots of tinkering with small experiments on this site. Those experiments
          are a testament to my iterative learning process as I picked up new skills and put them to the
          test to challenge the depth of my own understanding. Though these experiments aren't polished
          packaged examples of my work, they will still be accessible through the menu bar to mess with.
