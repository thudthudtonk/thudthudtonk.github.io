    <!-- 
        This page will be about my Chess Battler prototype
        Discuss the prototyping process, have gifs of test runs in back
        Discuss methods for organizing progress that did in the honors project thing

        Also reflect on how this project is currently out of my depth
        for a single person project, how expectations had to be tempered
        and the bugfixing experience

        Discuss the depth of conceptual design work that was done prior
        to starting the project, and how prototyping required paring concepts
        down to smaller starting points that could be expanded on
