        This will be about the Gentry Android game I made in my last HS
        CS class, and how I started a prototype adaptation in my free time
        at the start of college during the pandemic. Discuss challenges of
        it as it was my first foray into Unity and self-teaching. Discuss
        making some assets in Blender
    -->
