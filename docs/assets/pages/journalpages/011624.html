    <p>the sidewalk is just a road, and people don't follow the rules on it.<br></p>
    <p>please walk on the right side (or left if you are in england)<br></p>
    <p>most sidewalks are like single lane highways, with no passing zones<br></p>
    <p>you don't pass if you see oncoming traffic that you can't beat</p>
